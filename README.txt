你好，執行檔案在dis內的exe檔案
打開之後會出現一個視窗，請不要最小化他，放在背景就好

特別說明:
下載網路上的任何東西都有可能導致你的電腦有任何可能性的損壞
如果你下載了我的程式，之後發生任何事情都與我無關，謝謝。
我的程式內沒有放任何病毒或是惡意毀損電腦的東西。
但是介於之前有人因為免費提供程式給別人方便使用，對方一個月後電腦壞掉，反過來告他
避免這種事情發生，這些事情還是先講清楚得比較好。
如果你擔心這些事情發生是因為我的程式，那請你就別下載了，萬分感謝。
防毒軟體本身就會對exe執行檔特別偵測，但不代表他有病毒謝謝。
我自己執行程式，我的諾頓也會跳警告。

Special Note:
Downloading anything from the internet can cause any possible damage to your computer
If you download my program, nothing happens to me after that, thank you.
I don't have any viruses or anything malicious to damage my computer in my program.
But because someone provided a program for free for others to use before, the other party's computer broke down a month later, and in turn sued him
To prevent this from happening, it is better to make these things clear first.
If you are worried that these things are happening because of my program, please don't download it, thank you very much.
The anti-virus software itself will detect the exe executable file specially, but it does not mean that he has a virus. Thank you.
I run the program myself and my Norton also jumps the warning.
